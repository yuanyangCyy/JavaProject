# Rental Car System

This is a JavaFX project for a rental car system.  



Our car rental system has a total of 5 levels. 
The prices vary for each level. The prices also change depending on the duration of the rental. We can only rent and return the car for the same purpose.

The rental platform categorizes vehicles into five distinct levels, each representing a different class of comfort, performance, and price range.
These levels help customers quickly identify the type of vehicle they need based on factors such as size, features, and budget.
Higher-level vehicles typically include more advanced features, better performance, and higher rental fees.
